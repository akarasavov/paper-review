## **Introduction**

Lifeguard is extension over the swim protocol which is able to significantly reduce the false positive rate

## Motivation

Swim is:

- Robustness - if there is a network partition the system will still works
- Simplicity - protocol is easy for implementation
- Scalability -
- Easy of deployment and maintenance

Swim even a single overloaded member is sufficient to cause some false positive failure detection.

Lifeguard does not produce false positive until 16 machines are stressed concurrently.

## Swim and memberlist

**Swim has two components**

- Failure detector - detect failure of members
- Destination component - dessiminate updates about members that joined or left group

**Swim failure detector algorithm:**

1. In some protocol period(duration) each member pick one member and probe to send a message **ping**
2. If receive **ack then ok**
3. else â†’ send inderect probe to K members from the list. Every 1..K member try to probe the target member, if receive ack from the target member redirect the ack to the initial member.
4. If initial member doesn't receive ack from the probe period, mark the member as failed

**Swim dissemination component.**

- Each update about member joining or leaving the group or failing is shared with one other member L*log(n) times, where n is the size of the group and L is tunable parameter

**Suspicion feature**

- When failure detector fail to detect member it mark it with suspected state and suspect message is gossipied vie dessimination mechanism. Any member that receives a suspect message also marks the specified member as suspect. When suspicion timeout is reached, the suspected member is declared as faulty and gossiping of confirm message.
- If a suspicious send a alive message and reach all members then suspicision will be removed from the list.
- The alive message can be send by suspicious when it receive suspect or confirm

## Lifeguard

**Local health aware probe**

- The number of ack messages that have been received is compared to the number of pin and ping-req message issued. Missing ack could be due to local slowness

**Local Health Aware Suspicion** - replaces the suspicion stage of swim paper with fixed timeouts with dymanic timeouts

**Buddy system**

In Swim a suspected member is not guaranteed to hear of the suspicion at the first opportunity(lost messages, delay messages).

Buddy system replaces SWIM's piggyback message selector with one that prioritizes notifying a suspected member. This guarantees that any node that ping the suspected node will communicate the suspicion as a part of the ping.
